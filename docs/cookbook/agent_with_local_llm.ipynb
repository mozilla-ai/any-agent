We could also simply implement python callable functions that do these operations (e.g. using the os library), but instead we are opting here for an MCP server to showcase how easy it would be to swap or add other MCP servers to this use-case. To enforce that our agent doesn't go rogue and read/write in directories it's not supposed to access we will use the MCP server through a docker container that only has access to the directory above by mounting it.
